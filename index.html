# Aims

1. To understand the population-level consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity vs cross strain immunity
2. To determine whether epidemiological observations of population are consistent with this type of immune response

# Agent Based Modelling

An agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole (definition based on Wikipedia).

# Agent Based Modelling

1. ABM captures emergent phenomena; 
2. ABM provides a natural description of a system; and 
3. ABM is flexible
