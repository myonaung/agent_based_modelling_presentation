# Investigating allele-specific immunity of vaccine antigens

???

Notes for the _first_ slide!

---

# Aims 

1. To understand the population-level consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity vs cross strain immunity

2. To determine whether epidemiological observations of population are consistent with this type of immune response

# Agent Based Modelling

An agent-based model (ABM) is a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole (definition based on Wikipedia).

---

# Agent-Based Modelling

1. ABM captures emergent phenomena; 

2. ABM provides a natural description of a system; and 

3. ABM is flexible

---

# Methods (Agent based modelling)

1. Model of Malaria transmission (context of acquired allele-specific immunity **)

2. For each vaccine candidate antigen,
1. Turnover of alleles (longitudinal cohort – multiple timepoints)
2. Clinical phenotypes (Parasitemia + fever)
3. Serology data (to a single allele at first and last timepoint)
4. History of host immunity
